# Hydraulic Calculations - Sprinkler

## The pipe friction from the sprinkler rule


![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;p=K\times{L}\times{Q}^{1.85})

 - p = loss of pressure in pipe in bars per meter
 - Q = flow rate in litres per second (l/s)
 - K = constant depending n size and type of pipw
 - L = Length including equivalent lenght for fitting (m)
  
## The pressure loss at sprinkler 
![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;Q=K\times\sqrt{p})


## Find the location for calculation

### Hydraulically most favourable location

 - The pressure loss is minimum so the flow rate is maximum.

### Hydraulically most unfavourable location

 - The flow rate is minimum so the pressure loss is maximum.

## Calculation method

1. Check number of sprinklers are necessary to calculate.
   - Sprinkers in the Area of operation
2. Find the flow rate of the most remote sprinkler
   - Flow rate = design density x area per sprinkler
3. Check the minimum pressure of the sprinker

4. Calculate the pipe loss connected to the sprinkler
