# Fuse，MCB and MCCB

## Fuse characteristic

Fuse can protect the cable as the design based on the I²t (let through energy) similar to cables characteristic as above. The current limiting fuse charateristic as follow。

## Fuse circuit protection

Current limitation

Most electrical equipment has a withstand rating that is defined in terms of an RMS symmetrical-short-circuit current，and in some cases, peak let-through current。 These values have been established through short circuit testing of that equipment according to an accepted industry standard.。Or，as is the case with conductors，the withstand rating is based on a mathematical calculation and is also expressed in an RMS short-circuit current。
If both the let-through currents (IRMS and Ip) of the current-limiting fuse and the time it takes to clear the fault are less than the withstand rating of the electrical component, then that component will be protected from short circuit damage。

## MCB characteristic

MCB circuit protection

MCB has a minimum trip time 0.01s to 0.02s as below figure and limited breaking capacity generally it is not greater than 9kA (M9)。
Based on the above constaint, it will affect the selection between fuse and MCB for protecting cables。
The terms for MCB and MCCB about the maximum short circuit current：
Breaking capacity is defined as the maximum short circuit current that a breaker can interrupt without damage to it。
Making capacity correspond to peak values of fault current while breaking values are the rms values so making capacity is greater than breaking capacity。
